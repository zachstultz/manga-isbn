# manga-isbn-ocr-and-lookup
An automation script that pulls metadata for manga/light novels and injects it into those files.

The script is currently use at your own risk. It is not currently user friendly. I need to clean up some code, do a more proper readme with all the available options, and cleanup/fix the requirements. Give me some time.
